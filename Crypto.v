Perfect Crypto - Simple definitions for message encryption using
symmetric and assymetric keys

Perry Alexander
The University of Kansas

Provides definitions for:

- [keyType] - [symmetric], [public] and [private] key constructors.
- [inverse] - defines the inverse of any key.
- [is_inverse] - proof that [inverse] is decidable and provides a decision procesure for [inverse].
- [is_not_decryptable] - predicate indicating that a message is or is not decryptable using a specified key.
- [decrypt] - attempts to decrypt a message with a given key.  Returns the decrypted message if decryption occurs.  Returns a proof that the message cannot be decrypted with the key if decryption does not occur.

(** Key values will be [nat] by default.  Could be anything satisfying
 properties following.  *)

Definition key_val : Type := nat.

(** Key types are [symmetric], [public] and [private]. *)
Inductive keyType: Type :=
| symmetric : key_val -> keyType
| private : key_val -> keyType
| public : key_val -> keyType.

(** A [symmetric] key is its own inverse.  A [public] key is the inverse of
  the [private] key with the same [key_val].  A [private] key is the inverse of
  the [public] key with the same [key_val]. *)

Fixpoint inverse(k:keyType):keyType :=
match k with
| symmetric k => symmetric k
| public k => private k
| private k => public k
end.

(** Proof that inverse is decidable for any two keys. The resulting proof
 gives us the function [is_inverse] that is a decision procedure for key 
 inverse checking.  It will be used in [decrypt] and [check] later in the
 specification. *)

Theorem is_inverse:forall k k', {k = (inverse k')}+{k <> (inverse k')}.
Proof.

  | [ |- {private ?P = (inverse (public ?Q))}+{private ?P <> (inverse (public ?Q))} ] => (eq_not_eq (eq_nat_dec P Q))
  | [ |- {public ?P = (inverse (private ?Q))}+{public ?P <> (inverse (private ?Q))} ] => (eq_not_eq (eq_nat_dec P Q))
  | [ |- _ ] => right; simpl; unfold not; intros; inversion H
  end.

(** Various proofs for keys and properties of the inverse operation.  All keys
  must have an inverse.  All keys have a unique inverse.  Equal inverses come
  from equal keys *)

Inductive Sendable : Set :=

(** Basic messages are natural numbers.  Really should be held abstract, but we
  need an equality decision procedure to determine message equality.  Compound 
  messages are keys, encrypted messages, hashes and pairs. Note that signed
  messages are pairs of a message and encrypted hash. *)
